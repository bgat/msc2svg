**msc2svg** is an open source software written in java that generates good looking message sequence charts in SVG format from a text file (see [Example](Example.md)).
The advantages of **msc2svg** are:
  * the simplicity of the description file.
  * changing a part of the chart results in a lot of redesign and alignment work, if you do this in a graphic program. With **msc2svg** change what ever you want in the description text file  and recreate the complete chart in few seconds.
  * **msc2svg** helps you create the main part of your charts. You can continue editing them professionally with any vector graphic program like Inkscape for example.
